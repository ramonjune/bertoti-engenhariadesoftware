The second section introduces reflections on the development of softwares based on sustainability, and cites three principles for "Programming Over Time": "Time and Change", "Scale and Growth" and "Trade-offs and Costs".

<br>

## ü§ù Examples and explanations of trade-offs

<br>

- Storage against speed - storing compressed data to save memory against using caching to avoid recalculations.

- Functionality against simplicity - increasing complexity for advanced tools against making it more intuitive for more people.

- Security against usability - having high protection for important data against having convenience for easier access.
